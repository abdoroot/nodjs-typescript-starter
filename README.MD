# Node.js TypeScript Starter Project

This is a starter project for building a Node.js application using TypeScript. The project structure is designed to help you organize your code, manage dependencies, and maintain a clean codebase.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains all the TypeScript source code.
  - **controllers/**: Handles HTTP requests and responses. Each controller typically corresponds to a resource in the application (e.g., `UserController`, `PostController`).
  - **services/**: Contains the business logic of the application, interacting with databases or external APIs. These classes or functions are used by controllers.
  - **models/**: Defines data structures and interfaces that represent entities in the application (e.g., `User`, `Post`).
  - **routes/**: Defines the routing logic, mapping HTTP requests to controller actions.
  - **middleware/**: Contains custom middleware functions that handle specific tasks like authentication, logging, or request validation.
  - **config/**: Holds configuration files, including database connection setup, environment variables, and more.
  - **utils/**: Contains utility functions and helpers used throughout the application, such as JWT handling or logging.
  - **tests/**: Contains test files for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. Each test file mirrors the structure of the corresponding source code file.
  - **app.ts**: The entry point of the application where the Express server is set up and configured.

- **dist/**: Generated by TypeScript. Contains the transpiled JavaScript code. This directory is created automatically when you build the project.

- **Dockerfile**: A simple Dockerfile to containerize the application.

- **Makefile**: Contains common commands to streamline development tasks like starting the server, running tests, or building the project.

## Scripts

- **npm run start**: Start the application in development mode.
- **npm run build**: Compile TypeScript into JavaScript in the `dist` directory.
- **npm run test**: Run the tests.
- **npm run lint**: Run the linter to check for code quality.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Copy environment variables**: `cp .env.example .env`
3. **Run the application**: `npm run start` or `make run`
